# spotify-to-yaml-action

Export a Spotify playlist to Yaml.

This workflow can:

- Export your public Spotify playlist.
  - [Example workflow](#set-up-the-workflow)
- Automatically export last season's playlists.
  - [Seasonal set up](#seasonal-set-up)
  - [Example seasonal workflow](#additional-example-workflows)

## Set up

To connect your Spotify account to this workflow, set the following [secrets to your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository). You can find these values from the [Spotify API dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard):

- `SpotifyClientID`
- `SpotifyClientSecret`

## Seasonal set up

To take part in season playlist export, you will need to name your Spotify playlists with the following pattern: `YYYY {season}`. If you use different names for the seasons, you can use the `season-names` [action input](#action-options) to reflect that. Examples:

- `2021 Fall`
- `2021/2022 Winter`
- `2022 Spring`
- `2022 Summer`
