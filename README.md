# spotify-to-yaml-action

Export a seasonal Spotify playlist to YAML.

At the end of each season, the workflow will fetch last season's playlists, add the the contents to `_data/playlist.yml` and save the playlist thumbnail image to the repository.

## Set up

This workflow assumes that you named your Spotify playlists using the following format: `YYYY {season}`. Examples:

- `2021 Fall`
- `2021/2022 Winter`

You must also set the following [secrets to your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) to connect to Spotify. You can find these values from the [Spotify API dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard):

- `SpotifyClientID`
- `SpotifyClientSecret`
